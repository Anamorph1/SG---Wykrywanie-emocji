This is the implementation of svm algorithm (wrappers to e1071
library functions).
The two of functions are in svm.R file.

In parameters.R are descriptions how to prepare test data for learning the
svm machine (with example of random data creation).

In test.R is example of algorithm usage - how to learn the machine and
how to use learned machine to get type of object.
